## Introduction

Hi everyone, ForsakenIdol here. Little bit about myself: I have over 1000 Eidolon Hydrolyst captures, I've completed a solo 6x3, and I do 6x3 hunts in duos, trios, and full squads. I have played all of the possible roles in an Eidolon hunting squad; I've hosted a squad, and ran as either the client VS or the lure handler. I've ran 6x3 hunts with various different frames: Volt, Jade, Wisp, and Trinity, and it's safe to say that I have a decent amount of experience with fast, somewhat meta hunts.

I recently came across an excellent video going over the mainline Warframe content updates that have led to the steady decline of reasons to hunt Eidolons. There's no question about it - Eidolon hunting is a dying sport. Eidolon Arcanes can now be farmed through Vosfor packs, and Focus farming is more easily done by killing Thrax on the Zariman, or in Sanctuary Onslaught with a Focus lens. So why would you still want to hunt Eidolons? I personally still hunt Eidolons for a variety of reasons:

- Eidolon hunting, alongside Profit-Taker hunts, are an alternate endgame to archimedia missions that requires build planning and in-game proficiency. If you're looking for a skillcheck, consider getting into Eidolon hunting.

- Eidolon shards bypass the daily focus cap. I personally don't need to farm focus anymore, as I have over 100 million overflow focus in Eidolon shards, but other players still do.

- Eidolons are a lategame piece of content on a region that is available very early in the game's progression cycle. I've done a number of solo hunts in public squads to produce Eidolon drops for other players, and to show new players what they can do with the right gear. It's a fun way to engage with the community and for me to practise hunting on varying levels of ping.

- And most importantly, I think Eidolon hunting is fun! Don't focus on the meta too hard, just hang out with your squad, and have fun.

Today, I want to provide a method for new players to get into 5x3 or 6x3 Eidolon hunts with a **very** low gear requirement, where the only barrier to success is skill and practise. Today, I want to explain how to lure handle.

## The Basics

This video will **not** dive into the basic mechanics of Eidolon hunting, but I'll cover these very quickly.

- You can hunt 3 Eidolons per play session during night on the plains.
    - "3 Eidolons per session"
- These Eidolons are called the Teralyst, Gantulyst, and the Hydrolyst.
    - "Teralyst (Terry), Gantulyst (Garry), Hydrolyst (Harry)"
- Each Eidolon can either be killed or captured. Terry requires 2 charged Eidolon lures for a capture, while Garry and Harry each require 3 charged lures.
    - "Lures required for each capture: 2, 3, 3"
- Capture of the previous Eidolon tier is required to spawn the next tier of Eidolons.
    - "Always capture the Eidolon!"

Throughout this video, I'll be making reference to some Eidolon-specific acronyms that you may not be familiar with. I'll cover these acronyms in the video description, but feel free to let me know if I've missed any.

## 01 - Why do we lure handle?

One of the biggest hurdles that solo hunters come across when attempting a 6x3 hunt is how to lure handle effectively. This difficulty manifests in 3 main forms:

- Quick charging, which is when you try to get a charged lure as fast as possible out of the gate,
- Obtaining lures, and
- Charging lures.

The latter 2 are typically done either after breaking Eidolon synovia (aka limbs), or during the Eidolon's Weep phase.

The lure handler in a squad serves 2 main purposes.

- Fetching all required lures that are not the quick charge lure (because the host always quick charges), and
- Charging all lures from the 4th lure onwards.

It is also your responsibility as a lure handler to keep the lures alive until you pass them to the host. In order to pass a lure (charged or uncharged) to another player in the squad, you must first pause the lure by interacting with it. The other player will then walk up to the lure and unpause it, making the lure follow them instead. Depending on your frame of choice, you may also have the responsibility of keeping the lures alive, regardless of who the lure is following.

Lure handlers take on the responsibility of lure management away from the host, allowing them to focus on the actual Eidolon fight.

As a lure handler, you can immediately move to fast squads with minimal gear investment, while bringing value to and supporting veteran hunters.

## 02a - The Poverty Loadout: Trinity Prime

We're going to cover 2 classes of lure handler loadouts in this video. We'll start with the poverty loadout, which is aimed at new players wanting to get into this content as fast as possible, then we'll move onto a baseline loadout, which you can use if you want to lure handle more easily and eventually move to a different role in the squad, or even start to hunt solo.

Let's start with the poverty loadout, which only requires the Warframe and primary weapon to be built. We'll use Trinity, because when we hit the strength breakpoint, her 4th ability bless will completely restore the health and shields of all Eidolon lures and players within your affinity radius. This effectively gives you a "panic" button in case a lure gets stuck somewhere and keeps taking damage.

*\<display build\>* https://overframe.gg/build/666116/trinity-prime/beginner-lure-handler-trinity/

This is a 0 forma build, but it does require an Orokin Reactor. There is an ability strength threshold that allows Trinity's 4th ability, Bless, to fully restore health and shields of Warframes and lures in affinity range. As this is the main ability we will be using on Trininty and its range is tied to our affinity range, we can dump ability range on Trinity. For the remaining mod slots:

- Energy Nexus gives us steady energy regeneration over time. This can be swapped out with any other mod if you will be running the Zenurik focus school.
- Fleeting Expertise makes our abilities much cheaper to cast. This can be swapped with Streamline if you are running Energy Nexus or if you don't have Fleeting Expertise.
- Narrow Minded, Continuity and Augur Message give us a lot of ability duration. This allows a single cast of Bless to provide damage reduction for 18 seconds.
- Rush gives you sprint speed, which affects the speed of your archwing.

Note that if you put this build on regular Trinity, you will need a single forma anywhere in the build to make it fit. Alternatively, you can drop 3 mod ranks from anywhere on the build (excluding any ability strength mods) to make it fit with zero forma.

## 02b - The Poverty Loadout: Fulmin

Now, let's discuss our primary weapon, which will be the Fulmin. Either the regular Fulmin or the Fulmin Prime will suffice. Once again, this will require an Orokin Catalyst for 60 mod capacity. The Fulmin will be used for both acquiring lures and converting Eidolon Vombalysts into their spectral forms to charge lures. This is a standard crit build with radiation mods equipped, and fire rate is useful to increase lure acquisition speed.

There are no other weapons required in your loadout, but I would recommend equipping a melee weapon of your choice to allow you to melee slam out of archwing.

## 02c - The Poverty Loadout: Companion and Archwing

Your companion will be the Wyrm Prime, and you can use any companion weapon that can achieve at least 50% modded critical chance for companion bond synergy. Wyrm Prime is used for 2 reasons:

- Wyrm Prime has over 1200 modded shields with Calculated Redirection to allow us to use Tenacious bond.
- Wyrm's precept mod, Negate, allows us to negate one status effect every 5 seconds. This is particularly useful for the Hydrolyst stage of the fight.

Your Archwing will be the Itzal. Cosmic Crush is useful to allow Itzal's 3rd ability (which sucks in the vombalysts) to freeze them in place. Hyperion Thrusters is the only other recommended mod in this build to increase archwing flight speed.

## 02d - The Poverty Loadout in Action

Now, let's look at how to play the role of lure handler.

Your first job will be helping your host quick charge. Specifically, unless your host provides different instructions, you will be assisting with something called a 2+2.

*(Explain how a 2+2 works and how to do it)*

Now, let's put everything together and see a full Teralyst capture from the perspective of a lure handler.

I'll provide some common acronyms that are used within the Eidolon hunting community, as well as those that I use when hunting with my duo.

- 6x3: When you complete a full hunt, i.e. a full capture of all 3 available Eidolons in a given play session and extract, this is called a 1x3 - 1 play session where 3 Eidolons are captured. When you complete 6 of these play sessions in a row (capturing 18 eidolons in a single 50-minute night cycle), this is called a 6x3.

- VS: Stands for "Void Strike", but is also used to refer to the client player in a squad who's only job is to break the Eidolon's sentient shielding. In a fast / strictly meta squad, this player does NOT handle lures - the host handles lures.

- ds: Desync. This is used to refer to the situation where the Eidolon's animations stop playing after a limb shot. It's rare, but not relevant for you as a lure handler, unless you are assisting with shield breaks. Desync typically fixes itself after the next limb shot.

- Weep Phase: After the final limb / synovia on the Eidolon is broken, it collapses and enters this phase on a fixed timer.

- Capshot: The final damage dealt to an Eidolon before it is killed or captured. The capshot occurs after Eidolon stands back up after the "Weep" phase and the entire body becomes vulnerable again, for the last time.

- 2p / 5p: This is a callout to the number of lures paused by the lure handler, and simply means "2 paused" or "5 paused". It is assumed that "2p" refers to 2 uncharged lures, and "5p" refers to either 5 charged lures, or (if you can't charge all 5 for any reason) 4 charged lures and a 5th that is not fully charged. In 99% of cases, there is no reason why you should be pausing any less than 5 charged lures during the "5p" call.

- hb: "Have Backup". After the "5p" call, it's possible that another (9th) lure can spawn. You can grab this lure if you need a backup, should you lose one of the other lures. This is completely optional.
